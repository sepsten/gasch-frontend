# gasch-frontend

## Module structure

`/browser`, `/reader` and `/writer` contain code, styles, etc. for Gasch's three main frontend modules.
`/common` contains code and styles that are shared by all three, like the API client.
`/public` contains the compiled version of the frontend once it is installed.
